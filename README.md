A good tennis racquet is often over $300 to buy new, and often times older models are considered better than the newer racquets but they are no longer sold in retail stores. 

Since wooden racquets became a relic, the newer "modern" players racquet can last 20+ years and generally retain their playability quality. RacquetApp creates a dedicated online environment for the public to buy and sell their tennis racquets.

It caters for a beginner-intermediate player looking to get into the sport by purchasing a quality tennis racquet that isn't super expensive, or an advanced player looking to try out new racquets to up their game.  It also caters for collectors looking to add another classic to their collection.

Why is it a problem that needs solving?
---
The nature of reality is such that man is destined to suffer. As the buddhist philosophy states, the nature of seeking creates discontentment as happiness only occurs in a content, striveless state. Psychologists have labelled "flow" as the ideal state for the human psyche, with the sport of tennis being an exceptional way to enter this state. A perfect tennis racquet enables this state to be more easily entered, thus elevating society as a whole through the individual. 

There is a distinct demand in tennis for second hand racquets but there is no centralised place where this occurs. Currently buyers and sellers have to search the market, checking on websites like ebay and gumtree.
